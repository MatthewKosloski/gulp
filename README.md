# gulp
This is my starting point with [Gulp](http://gulpjs.com/) for static websites.  I was inspired by Hugo Giraudel's [7-1 architecture pattern](http://sass-guidelin.es/#the-7-1-pattern) and 
Dropbox's [Scooter](https://github.com/dropbox/scooter) SCSS framework.

## Installation
1. Download the repo's ZIP file.
2. Run `npm install` to install the Gulp plugins (node modules).
3. Run `bower install` to install the Bower packages.
4. Run `gulp`.

## Support
If have any comments, questions, or concerns, feel free to [email](mailto:hi@mtk.me) me or send me a [tweet](http://twitter.com/_mkos).  I respond to tweet's quicker, though.
